Introduction
==

Sophia is a functional language used in writing smart contracts on the aeternity block chain. The language is strongly typed, which means the compiler checks for syntax errors during compilation. Sophia uses Python-style layout rules to group declarations and statements. Blocks with a single element can be written on the same line as the previous token. Each element of the block must share the same indentation and no part of an element may be indented less than the indentation of the block.
